Task 3: Address book

This is a simple address book program. It allows you to add, edit, and delete
contacts. It also allows you to search for contacts by name or phone number.

This exercise is a little more challenging than the previous ones. You will
need to use the following concepts:

- Dictionaries
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Input and output

You will need to write the following functions:

- add_contact
- edit_contact
- delete_contact
- print_contacts
- search_contacts
